**1. Implement python programs for previous problem sets coded in C**
- [PSet 1](https://github.com/cuddlywhiskers/HarvardCS50/tree/master/PSet1)
  - [x] hello.py
  - [x] mario_less.py
  - [x] mario_more.py
  - [x] cash.py
  - [x] credit.py
 
- [PSet 2](https://github.com/cuddlywhiskers/HarvardCS50/tree/master/PSet2)
  - [x] readability.py

**2. DNA** : 
Implement a program that identifies a person by comparing their DNAs with several DNA sequences. The question looks into the highly diverse and repeatible STRs<sup>1</sup> (Short Tandem Repeats) found within human DNA sequence. As the number of repeats  differs from person to person, this makes our STR pattern highly unique to each individual! Multiple STRs will then be used for analysis to increase the probability of match between the STR sample and person. 
  - [x] dna.py
