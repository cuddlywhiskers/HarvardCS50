View problem set [here](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/psets/6/) 

**1. Implement python programs for previous problem sets coded in C**
- [PSet 1](https://github.com/cuddlywhiskers/HarvardCS50/tree/master/PSet1)
  - [x] hello.py
  - [x] mario_less.py
  - [x] mario_more.py
  - [x] cash.py
  - [x] credit.py
 
- [PSet 2](https://github.com/cuddlywhiskers/HarvardCS50/tree/master/PSet2)
  - [x] readability.py

**2. DNA** : 
Implement a program that identifies a person by comparing their DNA with several DNA sequences. The STR<sup>1</sup> (Short Tandem Repeats) found within our human DNA tends to repeat and the number of times these STR nucleotide repeats tend to differ from human to human. This makes our STR pattern quite unique to each individual! 
  - [x] dna.py
